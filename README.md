•With the power of GitHub’s API, we zeroed in on Austin's tech-savvy GitHub users, each boasting over 100 followers. We collected a treasure trove of details—from professional bios to preferred programming languages—shedding light on Austin’s coding culture.

•The most interesting finding was that JavaScript, Python, and Go are the most prominent languages in Austin's repositories. This highlights these languages as central to Austin’s coding culture and possibly reflects the local tech industry's focus.

•For developers wanting to resonate with Austin's developer community, prioritizing projects in JavaScript, Python, and Go is a strategic move to increase visibility and align skills with local trends.
